# Ginga GUI

This repository groups three Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for
Ginga (http://www.ginga.org.br) for end-users.

The three interfaces are:

  - __desktop-gui__: A Qt-based GUI for desktops. 
  - __fullscreen-gui__: A Qt-based GUI for emulating a TV user interface (we
                        mainly use it on minipcs).
  - __run-view__: is a [NCL
                  Composer](http://composer.telemidia.puc-rio.br)
                  plug-in supporting the execution of NCL
                  applications.
